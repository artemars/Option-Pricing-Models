    "In this notebook, I will begin by pricing European call and put options, assuming no dividend yield. I will allow the user to input the scaling for the \"up\" movement of the asset price, which is constrained to UD = 1. Next, I will create a similar function, but this time implementing the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model, setting a large default value for the time steps to improve convergence to the Black Scholes model. Following this, I will price American call and put options, allowing the input of a continuous dividend yield, again using the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model. Finally, I will price path-dependent exotic options using a Monte Carlo method, assuming a log-normal distribution for the asset price."

    "Below is a function that takes user inputs for all the necessary variables to price European call and put options using a constant scale binomial model (constrained to UD = 1). The pricing is achieved by multiplying the end contingent claims by their corresponding risk-neutral probabilities. This method essentially represents a shortcut to using a self-financing, replicating, previsible trading strategy, ensuring that at the child nodes, the portfolio value is equivalent to the effective option price."

The Monte Carlo method essentially exploits the central limit theorem, which, informally, states that the sample mean, as $ N \\to \\infty$, follows a normal distribution with the mean and variance being the population mean and the population variance divided by the sample size (N), respectively. This method randomly generates a multitude of realisations, essentially constructing a large sample, and then uses the consistent sample mean estimator to give an estimate of the population mean (which will, in essence, look like a draw from N($\\mu$, 0) as $N \\to \\infty$). Since the sample variance estimator is also unbiased and consistent, I will present the standard error, so, we should expect that upon repeated sample mean samples from this method, the true theoretical option price will be within +/- 1 standard errors from the sample mean in 68% of the repeated sample mean samples."

We should expect that the price is low as the threshold, given the volatility, should be exceeded rather regularly. As expected, such an option costs £0.02."

    "With the above methods, we can price options with a variety of payout functions. For example, imagine a mix of an up-and-out and down-and-out Barrier call option, in which if a lower or upper threshold is exceeded, the option expires worthless; otherwise, it has the payout of a normal call option. Or an Asian put option in which instead of taking the geometric or arithmetic means of the prices, we take the harmonic mean. I proceed with these type of option below to showcase the earlier claim.
